    "\n",
    "   The swiss cheese model portraits the numerous independent layers that overlap to eliminate  risk. It has a multilayer approach, this means in case of failure at one layer, the other layers will withstand potential breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Swiss Cheese Model is a framework that illustrates how multiple leayers of security  work together to create an impenetrable defense system. Each layer with its own strenghts and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The essence of the swiss cheese model is to keep in mind that a singular security measure is never foolproof when alone. It represents a system where each layer's weakness is covered by another layer's strenght.\n",

    "   1. What is a (D)DoS attack?\n",
    "      - Distributed Denail of Service Attack\n",
    "      - It is an attack that aims to bring down a server/ service with a coordinate request that consists of al large grouping of request.\n",
    "      - Example: [DDOS attack mitigation Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-auto-mitigated-world-record-3-8-tbps-ddos-attack/)\n",
    "      - ELI5\n",
    "        - Distributed Denial Of Service. \n",
    "        - Meaning there's multiple people/computers involved. So rather than one attacker, you've got a mob. Sometimes the mob cooperates willingly (eg, all participants agree they hate this particular business). Sometimes the mob is tricked into it (somebody spreads a rumor that a pizzeria is giving out free pizza, and the store floods with people expecting free stuff).\n",
    "   2. How can DNS be considered an attack vector as well?\n",
    "      - Firstly what is an attack vector\n",
    "        - An attack vector is a specific path or method used to gain unauthorized access to a system, network or application\n",
    "        - Examples of attack vectors\n",

    "        - First of all the DNS protocol is essential to every internet-based service.\n",
    "        - DNS is an inherently insecure protocol and a fundamental piece of operations of the internet and applications\n",

    "3. DNS\n",
    "   1. What information can be enumerated from a DNS server\n",
    "      - DNS Records:\n",
    "         - A-records = domain linked to ipv4\n",
    "         - AAAA-records = domain linked to ipv6\n",
    "         - MX-records = ip and location of mail server on network\n",

    "   2. When is it intended? What is considered a \"normal\" DNS resolve and how can you perform it using a CLI tool?\n",
    "      - It is intended on when the local dns cache doesn't know the IP address to the corresponding Domain. You can do this manually by using the command `nslookup` or `dig`\n",
    "   3. What is, and how can you perform a reverse lookup?\n",
    "      - The reverse lookup is a DNS query. It will look for the domain name corresponding with an IP address.\n",
    "        - This is basicly the reverse of a normal dns lookup where you use the domain name to get the corresponding IP address\n",
    "      - `nslookup` can preform the reverse lookup\n",
    "   4.  What is meant by authoritative nameservers?\n",
    "      - This type of DNS Server contains information specific to the domain name it serves.\n",
    "      -  Aswell as provide a recursive resolver with the IP address of that server found in the DNS A record, or if the domain has a CNAME record\n",
    "      -  It will provide the recursive resolver with an alias domain, at which point the recursive resolver will have to perform a whole new DNS lookup to procure a record from an authoritative nameserver.\n",

    "   - Standard Configuration Risks: Many systems come with default settings that are widely known and documented, making them easier targets for attackers. For example, default usernames and passwords are commonly exploited.\n",
    "   - Lack of Customization: Default settings may not align with the specific security needs of an organization or environment. They might allow unnecessary services or features that increase vulnerability.\n",
    "   - User Behavior: Users frequently stick to default settings due to convenience or lack of awareness, which can lead to security oversights. Research shows that most users do not change default configurations, leaving systems exposed.\n",

    "- Retention Policy: How long backups are kept before deletion.\n",
    "- Storage Location: Where backups are stored (on-site, off-site, cloud).\n",
    "- Testing: Regularly testing backups to ensure they can be restored successfully.\n",
    "- Security: Implementing encryption and access controls for backup data.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Full Backup:\n",
    "    - Advantages:\n",
    "        - Simplifies restoration since all data is in one backup.\n",

    "    - Version Control: Cloud services may overwrite files without retaining previous versions, leading to potential data loss.\n",
    "   - Accidental Deletion: If files are accidentally deleted or corrupted on the local device, those changes may sync to the cloud, resulting in permanent loss.\n",
    "   - Malware/Ransomware Risks: If a device is infected, malicious changes can propagate to the cloud storage, compromising data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When using a cloud storage to store backups, like OneDrive, you can assume they provide backups and maybe have a backup strategy in place. Why do cyber security experts state it is still not enough to only store critical data on (this) one place? In other words why is putting 100% trust on a cloud provider a (potential) bad idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Point of Failure: Relying on one provider can lead to significant data loss if that service experiences outages or breaches.\n",
    "- Vendor Lock-in: Dependence on one provider may hinder flexibility and options for recovery or migration in case of service issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "The fundamental goal of IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is to provide secure communication over IP networks by ensuring:\n",
    "- Data Confidentiality: Protecting data from unauthorized access through encryption.\n",
    "- Data Integrity: Ensuring that data is not altered during transmission.\n",
    "- Authentication: Verifying the identities of the communicating parties.\n",
    "- Replay Protection: Preventing attackers from reusing valid data packets to gain unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How does IPsec work? What are SP's and SA's?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. How IPsec Works\n",
    "- Traffic Identification: The process begins when a device identifies \"interesting traffic\" that requires protection based on predefined IPsec policies.\n",
    "- Security Association (SA) Negotiation: The devices negotiate SAs using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol. An SA defines the parameters for secure communication, including encryption and authentication methods.\n",
    "- Establishing the IPsec Tunnel: Once SAs are established, an IPsec tunnel is created over which data can be securely transmitted. This involves agreeing on encryption keys and algorithms.\n",
    "- Data Transmission: Data is sent through the established tunnel, utilizing either the Authentication Header (AH) for integrity or the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) for both encryption and integrity.\n",
    "- Termination: The IPsec tunnel is closed after the session ends or after a specified amount of data has been transmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Security Policies (SPs) and Security Associations (SAs)\n",
    "- Security Policies (SPs): These are rules that define how traffic should be handled, specifying which traffic requires protection and the security measures to apply.\n",

    "  - Generally, yes. OpenSSL generates files with specific extensions (e.g., .key for private keys, .crt or .pem for certificates) that indicate their purpose.\n",
    "- How can you view a certificate using openssl?\n",
    "  - You can view a certificate using the command:`openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout`\n",
    "- Does the webserver need a specific configuration change to allow HTTPS traffic?\n",
    "  - Yes, the web server must be configured to use the SSL/TLS certificate and private key, typically in its configuration file (e.g., httpd.conf for Apache)\n",
    "- What is meant by a CSR?\n",
    "  - A CSR (Certificate Signing Request) is a request sent to a CA to obtain a digital certificate. It contains information about the entity requesting the certificate and includes the public key\n",
    "- Tip: Do not forget the SAN (Subject Alternative Name) attribute!\n",
    "- What is a wildcard certificate?\n",
    "  - A wildcard certificate is an SSL/TLS certificate that secures multiple subdomains of a domain using a single certificate. For example, a wildcard certificate for *.example.com would cover www.example.com, mail.example.com, etc.\n",
    "- Tip²: (For the optional part below you might want to support a wildcard certificate)\n",
    "- What file(s) did you add to the browser (or computer) and how?\n",
    "  - Typically, you would add your SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., .crt or .pem file) to your browser or operating system's trusted root store or personal certificates store.\n",
    "- Can you easily retrieve your certificates after adding them?\n",
    "  - Yes, once added, certificates can usually be retrieved from the browser or operating system's certificate management interface.\n",
    "- Can you review and explain all the files from the OpenVPN lab and what they represent? CA? Keys? Certificates?\n",
    "  - CA Certificate: The root certificate that signs other certificates.\n",
    "  - Server Certificate: The SSL/TLS certificate for the OpenVPN server.\n",
    "  - Client Certificate: The SSL/TLS certificate for clients connecting to the server.\n",
    "  - Private Keys: Corresponding private keys for both server and client certificates.\n",
    "  - Diffie-Hellman Parameters: Used for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over an insecure channel."
