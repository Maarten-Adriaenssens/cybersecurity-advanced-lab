    "\n",
    "   The swiss cheese model portraits the numerous independent layers that overlap to eliminate  risk. It has a multilayer approach, this means in case of failure at one layer, the other layers will withstand potential breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Swiss Cheese Model is a framework that illustrates how multiple leayers of security  work together to create an impenetrable defense system. Each layer with its own strenghts and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The essence of the swiss cheese model is to keep in mind that a singular security measure is never foolproof when alone. It represents a system where each layer's weakness is covered by another layer's strenght.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Slices / Layers:\n",
    "      1) Web Filtering - Host-based Protection\n",
    "      2) Brower Extension - URL-based Security\n",
    "      3) Signature-based Scanning\n",
    "      4) AMSI Scans and Windows Integration\n",

    "2. What different type of network attacks exist?\n",
    "   1. What is a (D)DoS attack?\n",
    "      - Distributed Denail of Service Attack\n",
    "      - It is an attack that aims to bring down a server/ service with a coordinate request that consists of al large grouping of request.\n",
    "      - Example: [DDOS attack mitigation Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-auto-mitigated-world-record-3-8-tbps-ddos-attack/)\n",
    "      - ELI5\n",
    "        - Distributed Denial Of Service. \n",
    "        - Meaning there's multiple people/computers involved. So rather than one attacker, you've got a mob. Sometimes the mob cooperates willingly (eg, all participants agree they hate this particular business). Sometimes the mob is tricked into it (somebody spreads a rumor that a pizzeria is giving out free pizza, and the store floods with people expecting free stuff).\n",
    "   2. How can DNS be considered an attack vector as well?\n",
    "      - Firstly what is an attack vector\n",
    "        - An attack vector is a specific path or method used to gain unauthorized access to a system, network or application\n",
    "        - Examples of attack vectors\n",
    "          - Social Engineering\n",
    "          - Malware\n",
    "          - Web-based\n",
    "          - Network-based\n",
    "          - Physical attacks\n",
    "          - Password attacks\n",
    "      - Now How is DNS an attack vector aswell\n",
    "        - First of all the DNS protocol is essential to every internet-based service.\n",
    "        - DNS is an inherently insecure protocol and a fundamental piece of operations of the internet and applications\n",
    "        - Many DDOS attacks rely on ways to abuse DNS\n",
    "          - DNS Spoofing\n",
    "          - DNS Hijacking\n",
    "          - DNS Tunneling\n",

    "          - (Distributed) Denial of Service\n",
    "          - Ampification Attacks\n",
    "3. DNS\n",
    "   1. What information can be enumerated from a DNS server\n",
    "      - DNS Records:\n",
    "         - A-records = domain linked to ipv4\n",
    "         - AAAA-records = domain linked to ipv6\n",
    "         - MX-records = ip and location of mail server on network\n",
    "         - NS-records = ip and location of name server on network\n",
    "         - CNAME-record = links several domains together\n",
    "         - TXT-record = various text info\n",
    "         - SOA-record = info about admin\n",
    "         - Subdomain Enumeration\n",
    "         - Reverse DNS Lookups\n",
    "         - Zone Transfer\n",
    "         - Service Record\n",
    "         - TTL\n",
    "         - Info about version\n",
    "   2. When is it intended? What is considered a \"normal\" DNS resolve and how can you perform it using a CLI tool?\n",
    "      - It is intended on when the local dns cache doesn't know the IP address to the corresponding Domain. You can do this manually by using the command `nslookup` or `dig`\n",
    "   3. What is, and how can you perform a reverse lookup?\n",
    "      - The reverse lookup is a DNS query. It will look for the domain name corresponding with an IP address.\n",
    "        - This is basicly the reverse of a normal dns lookup where you use the domain name to get the corresponding IP address\n",
    "      - `nslookup` can preform the reverse lookup\n",
    "   4.  What is meant by authoritative nameservers?\n",
    "      - This type of DNS Server contains information specific to the domain name it serves.\n",
    "      -  Aswell as provide a recursive resolver with the IP address of that server found in the DNS A record, or if the domain has a CNAME record\n",
    "      -  It will provide the recursive resolver with an alias domain, at which point the recursive resolver will have to perform a whole new DNS lookup to procure a record from an authoritative nameserver.\n",
    "   5. What is a zone transfer attack and why is it called an attack? Is a zone transfer always harmful?\n",
